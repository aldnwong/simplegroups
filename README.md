# Simple Groups
1.21.1 Fabric mod to allow players to create their own groups. 
Requires Fabric API. Needs to be installed both server-side and client-side.
This is my first attempt at making a Fabric mod, so a lot of the code isn't amazing. I'd like to make a v2 version of this mod, but for now I'd like to focus on other projects.



# Commands
`/group config color <r> <g> <b>` - Changes the color of the group. Appears in the group member's display names.

`/group config joinOptions <joinOption>` - Changes how new members can join the group. `byInviteOnly` allows players to join if they are invited to the group by the leader. `anyoneCanRequest` allows players to join if they are invited, or if they request to join and are accepted. `anyoneCanJoin` allows anyone to join the group.
